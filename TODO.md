# TODO (in rough order)

- Setup the structure for model, storage drivers, flask app, testing
- Setup basic packaging and deployment (install via pip and run the service) 
- Document architecture, design decisions and how to deploy and run 
- Implement data model
- Implement the in storage memory driver
- Implement the business logic and API
- Refine deployment
- Setup sphinx

Each implement step is code + test + docs.
