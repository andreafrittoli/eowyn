# TODO (in rough order)

- Setup the structure flask app
- Document architecture, design decisions and how to deploy and run (in progress)
- Implement the in storage memory driver
- Implement the business logic and API
- Refine deployment (add run script, entry point)
- Setup sphinx

Each implement step is code + test + docs.
